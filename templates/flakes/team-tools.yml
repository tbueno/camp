# Example: Team/Organization Tools Flake
#
# This example shows how to integrate organization-wide tools and configurations
# shared across your team. This is useful for:
# - Company-specific tools and scripts
# - Shared development environment configurations
# - Team coding standards and linters
#
# Copy this section to your ~/.camp/camp.yml and customize for your organization.

env:
  COMPANY_API_URL: "https://api.company.com"
  PROJECT_ROOT: "/Users/me/projects"

flakes:
  # Company-wide tools (via private GitHub repo)
  - name: company-tools
    url: "git+ssh://git@github.com/company/nix-tools.git"

    # Use the same nixpkgs version for consistency
    follows:
      nixpkgs: "nixpkgs"

    outputs:
      # macOS: Import system-level configuration (requires nix-darwin)
      # This might include system-wide settings, fonts, or services
      - name: darwinModules.company
        type: system

      # All platforms: Import home-manager configuration
      # This might include aliases, shell configs, or development tools
      - name: homeManagerModules.company
        type: home

  # Team-specific development environment
  - name: team-dev-env
    url: "git+ssh://git@github.com/company/team-dev-flake.git"
    outputs:
      # Import team packages (linters, formatters, build tools)
      - name: packages
        type: home

      # Import team shell configuration
      - name: homeManagerModules.shell
        type: home

# After adding to ~/.camp/camp.yml:
# 1. Ensure you have SSH access to the private repositories
# 2. Run: camp env rebuild
# 3. Team tools will be available in your environment
# 4. Keep tools updated: camp env update

# Note: For private repositories, you may need to configure SSH keys:
# - GitHub: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh
# - GitLab: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/ssh.html
